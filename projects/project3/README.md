# Bistro Ordering System
Hello, and welcome to the Bistro Ordering System!

Requirements:
* Pwinput (pip install pwinput)
# Important Note!!!
The password input is finicky! Make sure you're using the option to run the files in a dedicated terminal or it will not work properly. You'll know it works if it masks your password with asterisks.
# Important File Directory:
* program.py - Run this to enter the usual system
* menu_editor.py - Edit the menu
* Reports/0_report_viewer.bat - Drag reports onto this to view them
* manage_users.py - Allows for the addition, removal, and editing of users

Any other files can probably be ignored. 

To log into anything with login, use the username "admin" and the password "password123"

When program.py is run, it should bring up a login screen, and then a dashboard. Be careful to only run from an IDE, as the imports are far too messed up to work from the terminal (sorry, if I keep the mandated folder structure there's no way around it). The rest should be self-explanatory.

The menu editor, as the name implies, edits the menu.

Drag report files (any .json file in the reports folder) onto 0_report_viewer.bat to view them.
