# Bistro Ordering System
Hello, and welcome to the Bistro Ordering System!

Requirements:
* Cryptograpy (pip install cryptography)
* Pwinput (pip install pwinput)

Important File Directory:
* program.py - Run this to enter the usual system
* menu_editor.py - Edit the menu
* Reports/0_report_viewer.bat - Drag reports onto this to view them

Any other files can probably be ignored. 

To log into anything with login, use the username "admin" and the password "password123"

When program.py is run, it should bring up a menu. Be careful to only run from an IDE, as the imports are far too messed up to work from the terminal (sorry, if I keep the mandated folder structure there's no way around it). The rest should be self-explanatory.

The menu editor, after you log in, should be equally self-explanatory.

Drag report files (any .json file in the reports folder) onto 0_report_viewer.bat to view them.
